# AndroidUtil - README

"AndroidMaterialViews" is an Android-library, which provides various views, which are part of Android's Material Design guidelines, but which are not provided by the official Android SDK. The library's views can also be used on pre-Lollipop devices.

The library provides the following views:

- A `CircularProgressBar`, which allows to visualize an indeterminate progress as an animated circle.
- A `FloatingActionButton`, which is a round, colored button with a shadow and an icon. The button supports to become shown or hidden in an animated manner.
