                 <h4>About</h4>

    	         <p>"AndroidMaterialViews" is an Android-library, which provides various views, which are suggested by Android's Material Design guidelines, but which are not provided by the official Android SDK. Since the library's views are designed according to the Material Design guidelines (even on pre-Lollipop devices), the AppCompat v7 revision 21 support library or a newer one is required to be used together with the library.</p>

                 <p>The aim of this documentation is to offer an overview of the project's source code and to explain, how the interface, which is provided by the library, can be used and how the underlying implementations are supposed to work.</p>            

                <p>The library provides the following views:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A <a href="javadoc/de/mrapp/android/view/CircularProgressBar.html" target="_blank" class="code">CircularProgressBar</a>, which visualizes an indeterminate progress bar as an animated circle.</li>
                    <li>A <a href="javadoc/de/mrapp/android/view/FloatingActionButton.html" target="_blank" class="code">FloatingActionButton</a>, which is a round, colored button with a shadow and an icon. The button supports to become shown or hidden in an animated manner.</li>
                </ul>
